#HTML (Hypertext Markup Language): The structure of the website is built using HTML to ensure proper semantics and accessibility.

#jQuery: jQuery is employed for interactivity and enhancing user experience through dynamic elements and animations.

#Features:
Responsive Design: The website is designed to be fully responsive, adapting seamlessly to various screen sizes including tablets and mobile devices. This ensures a consistent and optimal user experience across all platforms.

#Fresh Food Delivery Service: The main focus of the website is to provide information about the fresh food delivery service, including available products, pricing, and delivery options.

#Easy Navigation: Intuitive navigation is implemented to guide users through the website effortlessly, making it easy to find the information they need.
